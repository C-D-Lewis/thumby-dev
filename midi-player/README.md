# midi-player

Play a single track of MIDI music on Thumby.

## Choose music

Use the [`pico-pipes`](https://github.com/c-d-lewis/pico-pipes) project to
generate a `track.py` from a chosen MIDI file and track.

Copy `track.py` to the Thumby file system for this project to use it as the
source of notes when played.
